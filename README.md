Task 1:
Defining function get_birthdays_per_week that takes a list of users as input and outputs to the console a list of users who need to be congratulated each day of the following week.


Task 2:
Writing a console bot assistant that recognizes commands from the keyboard and responds according to the command entered:
1. "hello" - responds to the console with a following message — "How can I help you?"

2. "add username phone" - with this command, the bot saves a new contact in its memory, for example, in a dictionary. The user enters the name username and phone number phone, always separated by a space.

3. "change username phone" - with this command, the bot saves a new phone number phone for the username contact already existing in the address book.

4. "phone username" - with this command, the bot displays the phone number for the specified username contact in the console.

5. "all" - this command displays all saved contacts with phone numbers in the console.

6. "close" or "exit" — using any of these commands, the bot terminates its work after it displays the message "Goodbye!" in the console and completes its activity.
